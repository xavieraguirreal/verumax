  "commonChallengesAndSolutions": [
    {
      "challenge": "Spanish gendered past participles (aprobado/aprobada, inscripto/inscripta) translated to English where verb forms are naturally gender-neutral",
      "solution": "Replace with gender-neutral English passive or active voice. Example: 'ha sido aprobado/a' → 'has been approved' (no gender distinction needed in English). Store in placeholder {variable} if context-dependent."
    },

    {
      "challenge": "Spanish role titles are often gendered (docente/educador, profesor/a) with no direct English equivalent that is both gendered and professional",
      "solution": "Use gender-neutral English equivalents: 'instructor', 'educator', 'teaching professional', 'facilitator'. These terms naturally convey the role without gender specification. Maintain role accuracy through context."
    },

    {
      "challenge": "Pronouns (él, ella, ellos, ellas, su, sus) that are gendered in Spanish",
      "solution": "Use they/them pronouns in English (increasingly accepted in formal American English) or paired 'he or she' forms for maximum clarity. Example: 'su labor' → 'their work'."
    },

    {
      "challenge": "Compound Spanish descriptions that may imply gender through adjective-noun agreement",
      "solution": "Rephrase using English structures that are naturally gender-neutral. Example: 'una destacada labor como docente' → 'provided outstanding service as an instructor' (eliminates gender-specific adjective agreement in English)."
    },

    {
      "challenge": "Terms like 'persona', 'gente', 'equipo' (naturally inclusive in Spanish) must be translated to clearly inclusive English equivalents",
      "solution": "Map to explicitly inclusive English terms: 'persona educadora' → 'educator' or 'teaching professional', 'equipo docente' → 'teaching team' or 'faculty team', 'gente' → 'people' or specific role groups."
    },

    {
      "challenge": "Maintaining consistency when multiple role terms appear in document (docente, instructor, facilitador, orador, conferencista, tutor, coordinador)",
      "solution": "Create consistent mapping for each term and apply throughout: docente → instructor, facilitador → facilitator, orador → speaker, conferencista → lecturer, tutor → tutor, coordinador → coordinator. Use mapping table during translation."
    },

    {
      "challenge": "Institutional terminology that may be hardcoded in source but requires inclusive adaptation in target",
      "solution": "Preserve institutional terms exactly while ensuring surrounding language is inclusive. Example: 'Certificado de Docente/Instructor' → 'Certificate of Instructor/Teaching Professional' (adaptable to institution preference)."
