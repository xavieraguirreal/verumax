## Section 2: Course Status and Terminology (Keys 14-23)

**Key:** `courses_as_teacher`

**Spanish (Argentine):**
```
Participaciones como Docente
```

**English (Inclusive) - OPTION 1:**
```
Teaching Participations
```

**English (Inclusive) - OPTION 2:**
```
Instructor Participations
```

**Selection Reasoning:**
- "como Docente" (as a Teacher/Instructor) → avoid gendered "teacher"
- Option 1 "Teaching" uses adjective form, naturally gender-neutral
- Option 2 "Instructor" uses gender-neutral role term
- Both are correct; choose based on institutional preference

**Consistency Rule:** Once chosen, apply to all similar phrases:
- "Participaciones como Docente" → "Teaching Participations" ✓ (consistent)
- "Participaciones como Docente" → "Instructor Participations" ✓ (consistent)
- "Participaciones como Docente" → "Teacher Participations" ✗ (inconsistent with inclusive strategy)

---

### Example 2.2: Course Status Labels
**Key:** `status_approved`

**Spanish (Argentine):**
```
Aprobado
```

**English (Inclusive):**
```
Approved
```

**Translation Analysis:**

### Example 3.1: Academic Transcript

```

**English (Inclusive) - OPTION 2:**
```
Instructor Certificate
```

**Selection Reasoning:**
- "Docente/Instructor" is already attempting inclusivity in Spanish by offering both terms
- English should select the most appropriate single gender-neutral term
- Option 1: "Teaching Professional" is explicitly inclusive but formal
- Option 2: "Instructor" is widely recognized and gender-neutral
- Option 3: "Educator" is accessible and professional

```

**Translation Analysis:**

## Section 7: Teacher Participation Certificate (Keys 79-92)

### Example 7.1: Teacher Participation Introductory Phrase
**Key:** `it_is_certified_that`

**Spanish (Argentine):**
```
Se certifica que
```

**English (Inclusive):**
```
It is hereby certified that
```

**Translation Analysis:**
- Formal institutional phrasing
- Passive voice establishes authority
- Gender-neutral in both Spanish and English
- Professional tone appropriate for official documents

---

### Example 7.2: Participation Role Reference - Past Tense
**Key:** `participated_as`

**Spanish (Argentine):**
```
participó como {rol} en
```

**English (Inclusive):**
```
participated as a {rol} in
```

**Translation Analysis:**

| Element | Spanish | English | Inclusive Strategy |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------------|
| Past tense verb | "participó" | "participated" | Gender-neutral English past tense |
| Preposition | "como" | "as a" | English grammar requires indefinite article |
| Role placeholder | "{rol}" | "{rol}" | Preserved exactly |
| Final preposition | "en" | "in" | Simple correspondence |

**Key Inclusive Feature:**
- English verb "participated" has no gender conjugation (unlike Spanish "participó/participó" which sounds the same but implies gender through context)
- Result: Completely gender-neutral expression
- The {rol} placeholder carries role information without gender assumption

---

### Example 7.3: Current Participation Status
**Key:** `is_participating_as`

**Spanish (Argentine):**
```
está participando como {rol} en
```

**English (Inclusive):**
```
is participating as a {rol} in
```

**Translation Analysis:**
- Present continuous tense maintained
- English verb form is gender-neutral
- Indefinite article "a" provides proper grammar
- Role placeholder preserved for dynamic insertion

---

### Example 7.4: Role Assignment with Gendered Past Participle
**Key:** `has_been_assigned_as`

**Spanish (Argentine):**
```
ha sido {asignado} como {rol} en
```

**English (Inclusive):**
```
has been assigned as a {rol} in
```

**Detailed Analysis of Inclusive Handling:**

| Spanish Element | English Element | Inclusive Strategy |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| "ha sido" | "has been" | Passive voice maintained |
| "{asignado}" | "assigned" | **CRITICAL: Spanish gendered past participle {asignado/asignada} becomes gender-neutral English verb "assigned"** |
| "como" | "as a" | Article added for English grammar |
| "{rol}" | "{rol}" | Role preserved exactly |

**Explanation of Gendered Past Participle Conversion:**

In Spanish, passive voice requires agreement:
- "ha sido asignado" (if subject is masculine)
- "ha sido asignada" (if subject is feminine)

The file stores this as a placeholder {asignado}, suggesting context-dependent insertion.

In English, the past participle "assigned" is completely gender-neutral regardless of who is being assigned. The English solution simply uses "assigned" and lets the English passive voice handle it correctly for all genders.

**Result:** One gender-neutral English expression handles all cases.

---

## Section 8: Attestations and Constancies (Keys 95-109)

### Example 8.1: Regular Student Attestation Body
**Key:** `constancy_body_regular`

**Spanish (Argentine):**
```
se encuentra cursando activamente la formación:
```

**English (Inclusive):**
```
is actively completing the training:
```

**Alternative:**
```
is currently enrolled in and actively completing the program:
```

**Translation Analysis:**

| Element | Spanish | English | Inclusive Strategy |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------------|
| Verb phrase | "se encuentra cursando" | "is actively completing" or "is currently enrolled" | Active voice, or more literal "is taking" |
| Adverb | "activamente" | "actively" | Fidelity to source emphasis |
| Object | "la formación" | "the training" or "the program" | "formación" = educational program |

**Inclusive Aspects:**
- No gendered pronouns required
- English verb "is" + present participle form is naturally gender-neutral
- Emphasis on active participation applies equally to all students

---

### Example 8.2: Enrollment Status with Placeholder
**Key:** `constancy_body_enrollment`

**Spanish (Argentine):**
```
se encuentra {inscripto} para comenzar la formación:
```

**English (Inclusive):**
```
is enrolled to begin the training:
```

**Detailed Analysis:**

| Element | Spanish | English | Inclusive Strategy |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------------|
| Verb phrase | "se encuentra" | "is" | Passive construction maintained |
| Status placeholder | "{inscripto}" | "enrolled" | **CRITICAL: Gendered {inscripto/inscripta} → gender-neutral "enrolled"** |
| Purpose clause | "para comenzar" | "to begin" | Simple correspondence |
| Object | "la formación" | "the training" | Institutional terminology |

**Handling Gendered Placeholder:**

The Spanish source has {inscripto} as a placeholder, which suggests it could be filled with either "inscripto" or "inscripta" depending on student gender. However, this creates gender-based document differentiation.

English solution: Use "enrolled" which works for all genders equally. The English sentence is identical for all students, promoting inclusivity.

---

### Example 8.3: Introductory Phrase for Constancy
**Key:** `constancy_intro`

**Spanish (Argentine):**
```
Por medio de la presente, se deja constancia que
```

**English (Inclusive):**
```
By this document, it is hereby attested that
```

**Alternative:**
```
The following is hereby certified:
```

**Translation Analysis:**
- "Por medio de la presente" → "By this document" (direct) or "Hereby" (formal abbreviation)
- "se deja constancia" → "it is attested" (passive voice) or "the following is certified" (active with subject)
- Option 1: More literal, formal institutional tone
- Option 2: More condensed, also formal

**Selected Translation:** "By this document, it is hereby attested that" (more literal to maintain Spanish formality)

**Spanish (Argentine):**
```
Trayectoria Académica
```

**English (Inclusive):**
```
Academic Trajectory
```

**Alternative:**
```

```

**Why "Academic Trajectory" is Selected:**
- "Trayectoria" (trajectory, path) → "Trajectory" (most literal)
- Alternatives are valid but "trajectory" maintains the sense of progress over time
- All options are naturally gender-neutral
- Selected for fidelity to original meaning while using professional English

---

### Example 9.2: Course Timeline
**Key:** `course_timeline`

**Spanish (Argentine):**
```
Línea de Tiempo del Curso
```

**English (Inclusive):**
```
Course Timeline
```

**Translation Analysis:**

| `competency_trabajo_en_equipo` | Trabajo en Equipo | Teamwork | Direct, simple translation |
| `competency_liderazgo` | Liderazgo | Leadership | Direct translation |
| `competency_negociacion` | Negociación | Negotiation | Direct translation |

**Translation Analysis:**
- All competency terms are institutional/professional terminology

- Direct translation appropriate in most cases

---

## Section 11: Complex Plural Scenarios

### Example 11.1: Multiple Educators in Institutional Context

```
Los docentes e instructores implementan estrategias innovadoras
con el objetivo de facilitar el aprendizaje de sus estudiantes.
```

The instructors and educators implement innovative strategies
aimed at facilitating learning among their students.
```

**Analysis of Each Option:**

- "Instructors and facilitators" specifies multiple role types
- "implement innovative strategies" is gender-neutral verb phrase
- "facilitating student learning" is concise and clear
- Plural forms naturally gender-neutral

**Option 3: Literal to Spanish Structure**
- Maintains "and" structure from Spanish
- "aimed at" maintains parallel grammatical function
- More literal translation
- Slightly less natural in English flow

**Selected Option:** Option 1 (most natural English while maintaining professionalism and inclusivity)

## Section 12: Formal Academic Tone Maintenance

### Example 12.1: Avoiding Contractions

**WRONG (Informal):**
```
The student can't miss the course because it's required.
We don't want anyone to fail.
```

**CORRECT (Formal Academic):**
```
The student cannot miss the course because it is required.
We do not want anyone to fail.
```

**Applied to Verumax Context:**

**Spanish:**
```
Los estudiantes no pueden perder ninguna clase y deben entregar
todos sus trabajos a tiempo.
```

**English (WRONG - Informal):**
```
Students can't miss any classes and they've got to turn in
all their work on time.
```

**English (CORRECT - Formal Academic):**
```
Students cannot miss any classes and must submit
all their work on time.
```

**Inclusive Elements:**
- No contractions (cannot, must, not "can't")
- Plural "they" naturally gender-neutral (not shown but would use "they" not "he")
- Professional institutional vocabulary ("submit" not "turn in")
- Formal register maintained throughout

## Section 13: Placeholder Preservation Accuracy Check

### Example 13.1: Multiple Placeholders in Single String

**Spanish (Argentine):**
```

desempeñado una destacada labor como {formador} de "{nombre_curso}",
impartiendo sus conocimientos con un alto nivel de competencia.

| {nombre} | 2nd | ✓ Yes |
| {dni} | 3rd | ✓ Yes |
| {formador} | 4th | ✓ Yes |

**English Translation:**
```
On {fecha}, it is hereby certified that {nombre} with ID {dni} has
provided outstanding service as a {formador} of "{nombre_curso}",
delivering their knowledge and expertise with a high level of
professional competence.
```

**Verification:**
- Placeholder {fecha} appears 1 time in source, 1 time in translation ✓
- Placeholder {nombre} appears 1 time in source, 1 time in translation ✓
- Placeholder {dni} appears 1 time in source, 1 time in translation ✓
- Placeholder {formador} appears 1 time in source, 1 time in translation ✓
