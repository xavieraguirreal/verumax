================================================================================
INCLUSIVE LANGUAGE IMPLEMENTATION
================================================================================

DEFINITION: Inclusive binary language recognizes and respects gender diversity
by avoiding generic masculine defaults, using gender-neutral terms, and
explicitly acknowledging multiple genders.

THREE IMPLEMENTATION METHODS:

1. GENDER-NEUTRAL ROLE TERMINOLOGY (PRIMARY METHOD)
   Use gender-neutral English equivalents for Spanish gendered roles:

   docente/educador        → instructor
   profesor/a              → instructor / faculty member
   facilitador/a           → facilitator
   instructor/a            → instructor
   estudiante              → student
   alumno/a                → student / learner
   orador/a                → speaker
   conferencista           → lecturer
   tutor/a                 → tutor
   coordinador/a           → coordinator
   formador/a              → trainer / training professional
   personal administrativo → administrative staff
   equipo docente          → teaching team / faculty team
   personas educadoras     → educators / teaching professionals

2. INCLUSIVE PRONOUNS (SECONDARY METHOD)
   Use gender-neutral or paired-form pronouns:

   su/sus                  → their (preferred: singular they)
   él                      → he / they
   ella                    → she / they
   él o ella               → he or she / they
   ellos/ellas             → they

3. GENDER-NEUTRAL VERB FORMS (AUTOMATIC)
   English verbs are naturally gender-neutral:

   ha sido asignado/a      → has been assigned
   se encuentra inscripto/a → is enrolled
   participó               → participated
   aprobado/a              → approved

ACADEMIC STYLE SUPPORT:
  ✓ APA 7th Edition (explicitly supports singular they)
  ✓ MLA 9th Edition (accepts singular they)
  ✓ Chicago Manual of Style 17th Edition (permits singular they)
  ✓ CMOS (Council of Science Editors - accepts in formal writing)

================================================================================
FORMAL ACADEMIC TONE REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

NO CONTRACTIONS (required):
  Cannot use:  can't, don't, won't, isn't, hasn't, haven't, shouldn't, etc.
  Must use:    cannot, do not, will not, is not, has not, have not, should not

FORMAL VOCABULARY (examples):
  Avoid:       finish, get, help, tell, give, say, happen, around
  Use:         complete, receive, assist, inform, provide, state, occur, approximately

SENTENCE STRUCTURE:
  Maintain institutional authority and formality
  Use passive voice where appropriate: "has been approved" (formal)
  Avoid casual tone: "got approved" (informal)

================================================================================
QUALITY ASSURANCE PROCESS
================================================================================

TIMING ESTIMATE: 6-9 hours total for complete translation
  • Research & Setup: 30 minutes

COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID
================================================================================

PITFALL 1: Using generic masculine in English
  WRONG:  "The teacher must submit his report."
  RIGHT:  "The instructor must submit their report."

PITFALL 2: Inconsistent role terminology
  WRONG:  Translate "docente" as "teacher", then "educator", then "instructor"
  RIGHT:  Translate "docente" consistently as "instructor" throughout

PITFALL 3: Modifying placeholders
  WRONG:  "On the [date]" (removed {fecha})
  RIGHT:  "On {fecha}, it is" (preserved {fecha})

PITFALL 4: Using contractions in formal text
  WRONG:  "The student can't miss class."
  RIGHT:  "The student cannot miss class."

PITFALL 5: Losing context in translation
  WRONG:  Missing second verb: "has completed" (missing "approved")
  RIGHT:  "has successfully completed and approved"

PITFALL 6: Translating proper nouns
  WRONG:  Translate institution name from Spanish
  RIGHT:  Keep institution names exactly as in source

PITFALL 7: Inconsistent placeholder preservation
  WRONG:  Change {carga_horaria} to {hours}
  RIGHT:  Preserve {carga_horaria} exactly as is
